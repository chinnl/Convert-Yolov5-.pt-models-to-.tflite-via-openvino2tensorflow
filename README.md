In this repository, I converted Yolov5m weight in .pt format to .tflite format to deploy in android apps. <br />
I followed the instruction in this url: [Converting PyTorch, ONNX, Caffe, and OpenVINO (NCHW) models to Tensorflow / TensorflowLite (NHWC) in a snap](https://qiita.com/PINTO/items/ed06e03eb5c007c2e102). <br />
You can clone this repo and move the notebook file into yolov5/ folder to use.
